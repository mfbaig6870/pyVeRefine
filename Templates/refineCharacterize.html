        <p><b>a. Transient Throttle Characterization and Filtration</b></p>
        <p>
            This function processes a log file containing engine data and calculates the differences between
            consecutive values and their corresponding time intervals. The ramp rate of the throttle
            position (TPS) and air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) are then calculated, which is the rate of change of these values
            over time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A new data frame is created, including time intervals, TPS, and the calculated ramp rates, rounded to the
            nearest thousandth. The script then filters out instances of transient throttle, where the TPS ramp rate
            exceeds a specified threshold and the AFR ramp rate exceeds another specified threshold. The filtered data
            is saved.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This script is an effective way to preprocess and filter vehicle data for analysis, as it helps to
            reduce noise in the dataset and improve the accuracy of the analysis by removing instances of transient
            throttle that could interfere with the patterns and trends being analyzed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>b. Hit Count Filtration</b></p>
        <p>
            The process starts by reading the log file and applies a bin partition logic to transform the data into a
            format that corresponds to a volumetric efficiency table. This is done by defining partition ranges for RPM
            and MAP values, creating bins for these values using the partition ranges, counting the number of hits for
            each RPM and MAP bin, and then reshaping the resulting Series into a grid of RPM vs MAP with hit counts
            displayed in each cell. Finally, the resulting DataFrame is saved as a CSV file.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The second process then reads the dataframe generated by the first process, converts the columns to
            numeric data types, applies threshold values using Pandas, and saves the resulting DataFrame as a new CSV
            file. The threshold values are determined by setting all values less than 5 to 1 and all values greater
            than or equal to 5 to 0.
